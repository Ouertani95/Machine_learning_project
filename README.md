## Introduction :

- The main purpose of this project is to predict cancer types using gene expression 
data from RNAseq.
- There are 5 different cancer types : BRCA,COAD,KIRC,LUAD and PRAD.
- We used the following models for the predictions : 
    1. Multiclass logistic regression (MLR)
    2. Support vector machines (SVM)
    3. Random Forest (RF)


## Prerequisites :

- It is advised to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) on your system to run this code properly.
## Getting Started :

Once you have the prerequisites follow these instructions to prepare the code environment :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ouertani95/Machine_learning_project
cd Machine_learning_project/
conda create -n MLproject python=3.10
conda activate MLproject
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the code :

- You can run the **main.py** file to launch the code in your IDE or launch the script in your terminal 
using the following command :

```bash
python3 main.py
```
